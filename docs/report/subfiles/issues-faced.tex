This is a collection of issues that we faced throughout
the project. They are in no particular order,
though they are somewhat implicitly ordered
by milestone 1 to milestone 4.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Team coordination (mainly due to the fact that only really one person can work on the engine)
  \item{Writing the chess engine and debugging it was difficult,
  a more guided approach would have been better instead of trial and error}
  \item Writing unit tests early wasn't very useful
  \item Getting started was the hardest part, as we didn't quite know what to do (where to begin)
  \item{Using numpy mindlessly doesn't automatically make your code faster
  (it can actually make it slower!)}
  \item{OOP is really annoying to work with,
  especially if the design of the software is not to clear}
  \item Having huge functions with large logical statements
  \item Changing too many things at once (as opposed to having atomic changes)
  \item Commiting to things that don't pay off in the end
\end{itemize}

Most of these issues were very useful in the sense
that they made for great learning opportunities.
The lessons we learned during this project
is what we will be discussing in the following chapter.
