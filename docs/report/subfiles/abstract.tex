This report presents a detailed account of a project focused on the development of a King-of-the-Hill chess AI. The team faced several challenges during the project, including dealing with large functions with complex logical statements, managing object-oriented programming (OOP), and optimizing code for speed. These challenges, however, provided valuable learning opportunities. The team learned the importance of making atomic changes and gradually improving the code base, especially during the early stages of a project. The AI saw noticeable improvements over time, and the team was able to implement vast amounts of features  by the final milestone. Overall, the project was a positive learning experience for the team.
