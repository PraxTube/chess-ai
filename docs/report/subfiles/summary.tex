In this project we implemented our own chess AI and chess backend
in python. We had four milestones in total and the AI
got better with each. The final AI is able to play at a depth of 4 (plys)
in the mid-game. Some of the AI features we implemented are PeSTO,
MCTS, move ordering, Nullsearch and PVS/negamax.
We failed often, but learned from all of our mistakes.
Our team coordination was rough at first, but over time
it got better and better. In the final milestone
we were able to implement most features without any major
issues. Overall the learning experience was very positive
and build a really solid foundation for future projects.
