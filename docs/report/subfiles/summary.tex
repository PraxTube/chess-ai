In this project we implemented our own chess AI and chess backend
in python. We had four milestones in total and the AI
got better with each. The final AI is able to play at a depth of 4 (plys)
in the mid-game. Some of the AI features we implemented are PeSTO,
MCTS, move ordering, Nullsearch and PVS/negamax.
We made many mistakes along the way, but learned from all
of them and build a solid foundation of how to write software.
For instance we tried to implement Transposition Tables which
just didn't seem to work. In the end it turned out that the
pay off would have not been worth it anyways.
A lesson to make sure the things you are commiting to are actually
worth it.

The team coordination was rough at first,
milestone one was more or less done by a single member
because we couldn't all work on the backend simultaneously,
but over time it got better and better. In the last milestone
we were able to implement most features without any major
issues. Overall the learning experience was very positive
and a good experience all around.
